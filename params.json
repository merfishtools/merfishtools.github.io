  "body": "MERFISHtools implement a Bayesian framework for accurately predicting gene or transcript expression from MERFISH data.\r\nOn top, differential expression analysis can be performed for two or multiple conditions, including credible intervals for fold change and coefficient of variation, and controlling the expected false discovery rate.\r\n\r\nIt will soon be described in our forthcoming manuscript \"A Bayesian model for single cell transcript expression analysis on MERFISH data\".\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMERFISHtools can be installed and updated easily via [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/merfishtools/README.html).\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n[Johannes KÃ¶ster](https://johanneskoester.bitbucket.org)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](https://github.com/merfishtools/merfishtools/blob/master/LICENSE.md)",
